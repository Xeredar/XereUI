Welcome to XereUI

This UI is a very lightweight User-Interface for the game World of Warcraft, which utilizes the already implemented UI of the game and repurposes it to suit the needs of most players today. It sets up three different profiles to choose from, manages the CompactUnitFrames and works just from the get-go.

And the best thing is, it basically uses no resources at all to achieve this, since all the UI-Elements it uses are the default ones that are always loaded regardless.

To use this addon, simply download it and unzip it in the "addons" folder in your World of Warcraft directory. To change its settings, simply type /xui help while ingame to see a list of possible commands and options to choose from.

Sometimes the World of Warcraft UI elements - like the group frames - bug out when they try to update while in combat. If that happens, just type /reload to force the UI to update itself. It should fix most of the problems.

Feel free to report bugs while using it - although I have to warn you that I do not currently play World of Warcraft very actively and fixes might take a while.
