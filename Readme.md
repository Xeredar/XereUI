Welcome to XereUI

This UI is a very lightweight User-Interface for the game World of Warcraft, which utilizes the already implemented UI of the game and repurposes it to suit the needs of most players today. It sets up three different profiles to choose from, manages the CompactUnitFrames and works just from the get-go.

And the best thing is, it basically uses no resources at all to achieve this, since all the UI-Elements it uses are the default ones that are always loaded regardless.

Feel free to report bugs while using it - although I have to warn you that I do not currently play World of Warcraft very actively and fixes might take a while.
